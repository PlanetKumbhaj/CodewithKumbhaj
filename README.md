# #CodewithKumbhaj - 100 Day Challenge

Welcome to the DSA With Kumbhaj 100-day coding challenge repository! Here, I will be solving a minimum of 2 data structure problems daily on platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, or any other data structure and algorithm sheets. This repository serves as a record of my journey from basic to advanced problem-solving using Python and C++.

## Daily Progress

- **Day 1:** Learn about space and time complexity.

(Keep updating this section with your daily progress.)

## Project 1: Page Slider

In addition to daily problem-solving, I've also worked on a project called "Project1," which is built using CSS and involves page sliding. Feel free to check it out in the [Project1](/Project1) directory.
